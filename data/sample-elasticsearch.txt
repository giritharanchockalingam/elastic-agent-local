Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene.
It is the core component of the Elastic Stack, which also includes Kibana, Logstash, and Beats.

Elasticsearch stores data as JSON documents. When you index a document, it is stored and indexed
so that it can be searched in near real-time — within approximately one second. Elasticsearch uses
a data structure called an inverted index that supports very fast full-text searches.

Key features of Elasticsearch include:
- Full-text search with relevance scoring using BM25
- Vector search for semantic similarity using dense and sparse vectors
- Aggregations for real-time analytics
- Distributed architecture with automatic sharding and replication
- RESTful API accessible via HTTP/JSON
- Schema-free JSON documents with dynamic mapping

Elasticsearch supports hybrid search, which combines traditional keyword (BM25) search with
vector similarity search. This approach leverages the strengths of both methods: keyword search
excels at exact matches and known terminology, while vector search captures semantic meaning
and finds conceptually similar content even when different words are used.

The Elasticsearch Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a flexible JSON-based query language.
Common query types include match queries for full-text search, term queries for exact matches,
bool queries for combining multiple conditions, and knn queries for vector similarity search.

ES|QL (Elasticsearch Query Language) is a piped query language for filtering, transforming,
and analyzing data. It supports commands like FROM, WHERE, STATS, SORT, LIMIT, and EVAL.
ES|QL was designed to be easy to learn for users familiar with SQL or Unix pipes.

Elasticsearch indices can be configured with mappings that define the data types for each field.
Important field types include text (analyzed for full-text search), keyword (exact values),
dense_vector (for vector embeddings), date, integer, float, and boolean.

For production deployments, Elasticsearch clusters typically have dedicated master nodes,
data nodes, and coordinating nodes. Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policies automate
the management of indices through hot, warm, cold, and delete phases.
